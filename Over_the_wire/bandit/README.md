# OverTheWire: Bandit Writeups

Welcome to the **Bandit CTF writeups** section of my repository! This folder contains detailed walkthroughs for all levels of the [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame.

## 📘 About Bandit

Bandit is a beginner-friendly Linux-based wargame designed to teach core cybersecurity and Linux command-line skills through practical challenges.

## 📂 What You'll Find Here

Each level has:
- 🔍 A clear explanation of the challenge
- 🧠 Concepts involved (e.g., file permissions, SUID, shell escaping)
- 💻 Commands used and why they work
- 🚩 Steps to capture the flag
- 📝 Extra notes for deeper understanding

## 🎯 Goal

The aim of these writeups is not just to show the solution, but to **explain the reasoning** and tools behind each step — helping both beginners and intermediate learners strengthen their Linux and CTF skills.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Navigate through the files like so:

Where `XX` is the level number (e.g., `Bandit Level 00.md`, `Bandit Level 15_16.md`, etc.)
