# TryHackMe Writeups

This directory contains my **TryHackMe (THM)** writeups.  
The structure mirrors TryHackMeâ€™s own layout with separate folders for **Learn** and **Challenges**.  
Each room has its own subfolder containing a `Walkthrough.md` file with the detailed writeup.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- **learn/**  
  Writeups for all **learning rooms** on TryHackMe.  
  These rooms are designed to teach cybersecurity concepts step by step.  
  - Each room has its own subfolder with a walkthrough file.  
  - Example:

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  

Iâ€™m writing these walkthroughs as part of my own cybersecurity learning journey.  
The goal is not just to document solutions, but to keep track of what Iâ€™m learning and how I approach problems over time.  

Hopefully these notes can also help other beginners who are starting out with TryHackMe. If you stumble upon this repo and have feedback, suggestions, or different ways of solving the rooms, Iâ€™d love to hear your perspective . We all grow better by sharing knowledge.
