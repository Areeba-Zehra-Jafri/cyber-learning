# Cybersecurity Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a collection of writeups, notes, and learning resources as I explore the field of cybersecurity. I'm currently working through beginner-friendly CTF platforms like:

- [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org)
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- And more...

## Why I Made This Repo
I'm using this repo to:
- Track my learning and progress
- Deepen my understanding by documenting challenges
- Help other beginners who might be on the same path
